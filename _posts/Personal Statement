## Personal Statement

Welcome to my first blog post! 

This post is my personal statement. It will give you a brief overview about myself.

---

I am an undergraduate student and an aspiring UX designer specializing in the field of AI. I have an academic background in human-computer interactions and laboratory experience in artificial intelligence. I conducted research and development for official tasks from the National Information Society Agency and the Department of Defense related to FRVT (Face Recognition Vendor Test).

As a creative and entrepreneurial thinker, I have taken on various leadership roles, including founding and incubating two workstation projects that received multiple awards and university grants and was shortlisted as finalist for 2022 Social-Venture IR competition at Yonsei University.

Additionally, I am the recipient of the Light-Up Scholarship, a two-year scholarship for students that are making meaningful changes in society, as well as the Yoon Ja Young scholarship, a scholarship for next-generation women entrepreneurs that are inspiring and uplifting others in the community.

My passion is keeping up with recent advancements in the field of AI, and humanizing these technologies to improve user experiences in the upcoming generation. I hope to lead the advancement of the human-centered partnership model of people and AI working together.

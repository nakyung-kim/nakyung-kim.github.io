Hello and welcome! I am Nakyung. 

I am an undergraduate student and an aspiring UX designer specializing in the field of AI. I have an academic background in human-computer interactions and laboratory experience in artificial intelligence. 

As a creative and entrepreneurial thinker, I have taken on various leadership roles, including founding and incubating two workstation projects that received multiple awards and university grants and was shortlisted as finalist for 2022 Social-Venture IR competition at Yonsei University.

Additionally, I am the recipient of the Light-Up Scholarship, a two-year scholarship for students that are making meaningful changes in society, as well as the Yoon Ja Young scholarship, a scholarship for next-generation women entrepreneurs that are inspiring and uplifting others in the community.

My passion lies in humanizing AI to enhance user experiences for the next generation. Feel free to reach out to me via linkedin dm :)
